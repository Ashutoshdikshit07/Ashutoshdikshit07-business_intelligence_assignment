1) With Jio coming in, we have seen an influx of internet users from Tier 2 and Tier 3.
Video/Content apps like Youtube and Tiktok have seen a huge growth while
Amazon/Flipkart havenâ€™t seen similar.
What could be the reason for it? Feel free to use any publicly available data to support
your hypotheses.

Tier 2 cites include Agra, Nagpur, Lucknow, etc and all the other cities except tier 1 
and tier 2 comes under tier 3 category.
As we know tier 2 cities are the developing cities with rapid growth rate in industries
and tier 3 cities have low cost of living, poor infrastructure. etc.

let it be tier 1 or 2 or 3 , people never gets bored of watching videos, movies, or funny clips
and there is an entire library of it on youtube and people on tiktok creates intresting content.
which new generation is intrested in watching.

Before Jio there was a limitation on the usage of data also it was costly for middle class people.
(around 300mb for 100rs that too for a month ).Only limited numbers of people used youtube. 
to save data and use it for a month.

But with the launch of jio internet was free for almost 3 years with 1 gb per day.
this was a big leap , usage of data jumped from 300 mb per month to 1.5 gb per day.
with this much amount of data and low cost, people started doing the most what they like, ie watching videos online.

Data was collected by Kotak Institutional equities to show that at an industry level, data 
volumes rose 4160% to 20.3 billion GB in july -sept 2019 period. This is in comparison to the april-june 2016.

Now, Amazon, Flipkart is an online shopping websites which sells diffrent items. And unlike youtube which is an online video-sharing platform,
importantly its free. and we all know people like free things.

all though these are two diffrent things.
lets hope these shopping websites start selling items for free and boom you can see the growth here as well.
